# ⚡ Advanced NumPy — Deep Dive into Numerical Python

This repository contains my notes, experiments, and practice notebooks from the **Advanced NumPy** 

NumPy is the foundation of Python’s scientific stack — mastering it means writing *faster*, *cleaner*, and *more efficient* code.  
This repo explores how NumPy works under the hood and how to use it like a pro.

---

### 🧠 Advanced Indexing & Slicing
- Boolean, fancy, and structured indexing
- Broadcasting rules
- Strides and memory layout
- Vectorization and eliminating loops

### 🧮 Broadcasting 
- Understand how NumPy automatically expands array shapes for arithmetic operations.
- Perform element-wise operations without explicit loops.
- Use broadcasting to simplify multi-dimensional mathematical expressions.

### Custom Mathematical Formulas 
- Create and apply your own mathematical formulas using vectorized NumPy operations.
- Combine multiple arrays efficiently with element-wise functions.
- Implement formulas using np.exp, np.log, and trigonometric functions.
- Replace loops with vectorized expressions for faster execution.

### Working with Missing Values using np.nan
- Identify missing or invalid data using np.isnan.
- Perform safe calculations while ignoring NaN values.

### 🧬 Under the Hood
- How arrays are stored in memory (C-contiguous vs F-contiguous)
- Broadcasting internals
- UFuncs (Universal Functions) and how they work
- Extending NumPy with custom UFuncs and C extensions
