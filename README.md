# ⚡ Advanced NumPy — Deep Dive into Numerical Python

This repository contains my notes, experiments, and practice notebooks from the **Advanced NumPy** 

NumPy is the foundation of Python’s scientific stack — mastering it means writing *faster*, *cleaner*, and *more efficient* code.  
This repo explores how NumPy works under the hood and how to use it like a pro.

## 🚀 Topics Covered

### 🧩 Core Array Concepts
- Array creation and manipulation
- Data types (`dtype`) and type casting
- Shape, rank, and dimensionality
- Views vs copies

### 🧠 Advanced Indexing & Slicing
- Boolean, fancy, and structured indexing
- Broadcasting rules
- Strides and memory layout
- Vectorization and eliminating loops

### ⚙️ Performance Optimization
- Using `np.vectorize`, `np.fromfunction`, `np.apply_along_axis`
- Profiling NumPy code (`%timeit`, `cProfile`)
- Memory efficiency and in-place operations
- Comparing NumPy with pure Python loops

### 🧵 Linear Algebra & Randomness
- Matrix operations (`dot`, `matmul`, `einsum`)
- Eigenvalues, SVD, and decomposition
- Random number generation with `numpy.random`
- Statistical operations and sampling

### 🧬 Under the Hood
- How arrays are stored in memory (C-contiguous vs F-contiguous)
- Broadcasting internals
- UFuncs (Universal Functions) and how they work
- Extending NumPy with custom UFuncs and C extensions
